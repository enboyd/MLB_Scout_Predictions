# MLB_Scout_Predictions
A personal project that will predict a player's tools on the scouting grade scale (20-80) using natural language processing.

This will be done through Python version 3.8. 

The data are from www.prospectslive.com/ and will contain infromation about prospects from a 2021 MidSeason Report and a 2022 Preseason Report by the website. While some players might be the same in the reports, there are different scouts and different grades for some players, but any players that have identical grades and notes from each report will be removed.
